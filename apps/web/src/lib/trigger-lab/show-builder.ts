/* Adapter: the lab's editable config (the rune-backed `store`) → a `voice.Show`,
   the authored-content aggregate the real server engine runs. The lab's `sim.ts`
   types were the SOURCE the core `voice` types were ported from, so the shapes are
   structurally identical (Bus / Preset / Section / EffectDef / GraphNode / Envelope
   / TriggerGraph all line up field-for-field). That lets us assemble the Show by
   structural assignment with no `as any` — TypeScript's structural typing accepts
   the web instances wherever the core nominal type is expected.

   If a future divergence appears between the two type sets, this is the single
   place to map it explicitly (rather than casting at the call site). */
