# Rock Solid — master tracker

Master orch state for issues #46–#57 (49 slices). Operating manual: `docs/plans/2026-07-02-rock-solid/ORCHESTRATION.md` (rev 2). Slice plan: `docs/plans/2026-07-02-rock-solid/slices/INDEX.md`. This tracker + those two docs must always be enough for a successor master to take over (compaction can wipe context at any wake).

---

## ESCALATIONS / notes

- **Disk headroom (MONITOR):** volume was at 99% / ~8.3 GB free at initiative start. pnpm's hardlinked global store makes each worktree `node_modules` nearly free (verified: 4 installs, no measurable disk delta). **Risk remains for Lane 4** (desktop/tauri) — Rust `target/` build dirs are NOT hardlinked and can be large. Watch `df -h /Users/trent` before/around Lane 4; if a build fails on ENOSPC, that is a blocking escalation to Trent.
- **Cross-group merge drift (process lesson):** group/E was branched off rock-solid PRE-group-B, so B×E independently edited shared files (`store.svelte.ts`, two inspectors) → non-trivial semantic conflict at master-merge time. Handed back to the lane orch to integrate (merge rock-solid into group/E + resolve) rather than hand-merge entangled feature code as master. **Guidance for Lane 2+:** lane orch should `git merge rock-solid` into a group branch (resolving) BEFORE handing it off, so master merges are clean — especially when groups within a lane overlap in time.
- **Topology deviation (recorded):** the doc names a 3-worktree pool (`wt-1|2|3`). I additionally created **`../ledrums-wt/wt-master` on `rock-solid`** for the master's own tracker commits + group-branch merges + post-merge sweeps. Rationale: the main working tree (`~/Documents/dev/ledrums`) is dirty with Trent's unrelated local desktop/tauri work (`.dmg`, tauri configs, `.infisical.json`) and must stay pristine; a single branch can't be checked out in two worktrees. `wt-1/2/3` remain the impl pool exactly as the doc specifies.

## Worktree pool

| Worktree | Path | Role | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| wt-master | `../ledrums-wt/wt-master` | master: tracker commits, group merges, post-merge sweep | on `rock-solid` |
| wt-1 | `../ledrums-wt/wt-1` | impl pool | free (detached) |
| wt-2 | `../ledrums-wt/wt-2` | impl pool | free (detached) |
| wt-3 | `../ledrums-wt/wt-3` | impl pool | free (detached) |

All four `pnpm install`ed. Assignment discipline: `git -C <wt> status --porcelain` must be EMPTY before assigning; impl starts with `git -C <wt> fetch --all && git -C <wt> switch -c slice/S## group/<letter>`.

## Branch topology

- Integration: **`rock-solid`** (created off `main` @ ca0d70c, pushed to origin). Merges to `main` only at the final gate, with Trent.
- Group: `group/<letter>` off `rock-solid` (lane orch creates at group start).
- Slice: `slice/S##` off the group branch (impl creates in its worktree).

## State snapshot (per wake — newest on top)

### 2026-07-02T14:2x — ✅ LANE 1 COMPLETE; Lane 2 launched

- **group/E re-handed off clean** (lane orch merged rock-solid into group/E, resolved all 4 B×E conflicts exactly as instructed; pinned the receiveInputEcho-records-activity seam with +2 tests in store.echo-gate.test.ts). No conflicts on my side.
- **group/E MERGED** → rock-solid as **ab5bc96** (`--no-ff`), pushed (local==origin). Master full sweep GREEN: typecheck 0 (web 2227 files); **1177 tests / 0 skips** (io 13 · core 251 · protocol 1 · server 176 · web 736).
- **LANE 1 DONE** — all 11 slices (A/B/E) in rock-solid. **Killed lane-1-b0cea3** (resumable: `twux resume --session lane-1-b0cea3`).
- **LANE 2 LAUNCHED: lane-2-988e46** (fable/high, own window). Assigned F→G→H→I (msg 660997) with the NEW rule: integrate rock-solid into each group + resolve BEFORE handoff. Usage 5h 58% at launch (limited headroom before 18:00 UTC reset; lane orch will pause at 70%).
- **Next:** 30-min cadence; watch for Lane 2 group hand-offs (F first) → merge → sweep. group/A,B,E branches still exist locally (merged; optional tidy).

### 2026-07-02T14:1x — LANE 1 slices done; group/E merge BOUNCED (B×E conflict)

- **Lane 1 all 11 slices complete** (A:S01, B:S02–S05, E:S12–S17). Lane orch handed off group/E (PASS, its sweep 1111 tests). A+B already in rock-solid.
- **group/E did NOT merge cleanly** into rock-solid (has A+B): 4 conflicts — design-system.html (regen), PatchZoneInspector + TriggerSourceInspector (additive UNION), and **store.svelte.ts (4 hunks, semantically entangled)**: B's input-activity-badge (recordInputActivity, S04) vs E's authority refactor (receiveInputEcho, S12) both rewrote input handling. Risk: E's `receiveInputEcho` must ALSO recordInputActivity or B's badges silently break on the echo path — likely UNTESTED seam.
- **ABORTED my merge** (rock-solid untouched @ 7929593). **Handed back to lane-1-b0cea3** (msg 0e49b3) with exact resolution steps: merge rock-solid into group/E in a pool worktree, resolve the 4 conflicts, ADD a test for receiveInputEcho-records-activity, re-review the store seam, re-hand-off. Lane orch NOT killed.
- **Lane 2 still deferred** (Lane 1 not complete until group/E merges).
- **Next:** await re-handoff of group/E → clean merge (group/E will contain rock-solid) + sweep → Lane 1 DONE → fire Lane 2 orch. Check wake ~18 min.

### 2026-07-02T13:49 — wake: group/E nearly done (S16+S17 last)

- **group/E:** S12/S13/S14/S15 all merged into group/E (lane orch, 4 slice merges). **S16-looks-authoring + S17-layersdock in flight** (last two E slices) — then group review + handoff = Lane 1 complete.
- Usage 5h 34% (healthy). Inbox empty; rock-solid unchanged (no group/E handoff yet — nothing for master to merge).
- **Next:** await group/E handoff → merge (wt-master) + sweep → Lane 1 DONE → fire Lane 2 orch (F→G→H→I). 30-min wake re-armed.

### 2026-07-02T13:05 — RESET reached, Lane 1 resumed (nudged)

- **5h budget reset to 0%** (next reset 2026-07-03T04:00+10). Full runway.
- **Lane 1 `lane-1-b0cea3`** was found parked idle at prompt 5 min past its 13:00 reset wake (context healthy 19%; footer showed stale 91%). Rather than risk idle crew, I sent a **resume nudge** (msg 629a67) with dup-safety instructions (check `twux list` before relaunching any S13–S17 impl). It should now launch the E wave: S13+S14+S15 parallel → S17 → S16.
- **group/E** exists with **S12 merged** (lane orch, pre-pause, sweep green 1047 tests — authority principle: echo=learn-only, all outbound sim gated on link). Remaining E: S13/S14/S15/S17/S16 → group review → hand off to master.
- **A+B merged** to rock-solid (a91dbbf, 74ffd7a). **Lane 2 still deferred** (serial; fires when group/E merged).
- **CONFIRMED 13:18:** E wave live — S13-firegraph (wt-1), S14-drumlink (wt-2), S15-section-looks (wt-3), all opus/xhigh, no dups (dup-safety held). Lane orch resumed (msg df2c81). Pipeline: S17 → free worktree, S16 after S15, then group review + handoff = Lane 1 done.
- **Next:** 30-min cadence; merge group/E when handed off; then fire Lane 2 orch (F→G→H→I).

### 2026-07-02T09:41 — GROUP B MERGED + BUDGET PAUSE

- **group/B merged** (#47, S02–S05) → rock-solid as merge commit **74ffd7a** (`--no-ff`, ort), pushed (local == origin). Verified report + diff scope (web-only + 1-line .gitignore, 4 pure modules, tests, design-system engaged) before merging.
- **Conflict resolved:** only `docs/design-system.html` conflicted (generated file — both A and B regenerated it). Source `.svelte` styleguide files auto-merged cleanly; I re-ran `pnpm design-system` to regenerate the HTML from merged sources (0 markers). This is the standing recipe for design-system.html merge conflicts.
- **Master sweep green (A+B combined):** typecheck 0 (web 2220 files); **1101 tests / 0 skips** (io 13 · core 234 · protocol 1 · server 170 · web 683).
- **⛔ BUDGET PAUSE:** lane orch reported 5h usage hit 86% (msg f205b1); now **89%**, resets **2026-07-02T23:00:00+10:00 (13:00 UTC)**. 7d 18% (healthy). Lane 1 stopped NEW launches; S12 finishing then merging into group/E; E remainder (S13/S14/S15/S17 → S16) BLOCKED until reset. Lane orch scheduled its own `--at` reset wake w/ pre-written assignments.
- **Lane 2 NOT started** (lanes serial — Lane 2 fires only when Lane 1 completes = group/E merged, which is post-reset). No master action until reset.
- **Next (at/after 13:00 UTC reset):** verify Lane 1 resumed + progressing; await group/E hand-off → merge → Lane 1 done → fire Lane 2 orch (F→G→H→I). Re-align master wake to the reset (pending 09:44 wake will re-arm it there).

### 2026-07-02T09:2x — GROUP A MERGED → rock-solid

- **group/A merged** (#46, S01) into rock-solid as merge commit **a91dbbf** (`--no-ff`, ort), pushed to origin (local == origin/rock-solid == a91dbbf). Lane orch verdict was PASS/no-findings; I re-read the report + diff scope (web-only, graph-editor hardening, tests + design-system regenerated in-change, no core/IO impurity), merged, ran my own full sweep.
- **Master sweep green:** typecheck 0 (6 pkgs, web svelte-check 2208 files 0 errors); tests pass (web 619/619; merge clean single-slice so io/core/protocol/server unchanged from lane orch's verified 1037/no-skips). `derived_inert` Svelte warnings on stderr are pre-existing noise, not failures.
- **Lane 1 continues:** B has S02+S03 merged (S03 sweep was pending at hand-off), S04 in flight, S05 next; E not started. Told lane orch (ack 640e55) to branch group/E + future groups off LATEST rock-solid (fetch first). group/A branch left intact (merged; optional tidy later).
- **Next:** await group/B then group/E hand-offs. When all three merged → Lane 1 done → fire Lane 2 orch (F→G→H→I).

### 2026-07-02T09:14 — wake 1: Lane 1 progressing, no merges yet

- **Lane 1 `lane-1-b0cea3` alive + progressing.** Reported (08:50): ACK'd, `group/A`+`group/B` created off rock-solid; impls S01→wt-1, S02→wt-2, S03→wt-3 launched (opus/xhigh). At 09:14 `twux list`: S01/S03/S04 impls alive (S04 launched 09:08 → S02 already landed, freed wt-2). Lane usage 5h ~30%.
- **Merges into rock-solid:** none yet (rock-solid log still at tracker commits; no group handed off). Nothing for master to do this cycle.
- **Verified evidence:** inbox msg c32b58 (progress); `twux list` shows lane-1 + S01/S03/S04 impls alive; `git branch group/*` = group/A, group/B; wt-master rock-solid log unchanged.
- **Next actions (next wake):** same cadence; watch for group A/B hand-off (→ merge in wt-master + sweep). When Lane 1 done → fire Lane 2 orch (F→G→H→I).

### 2026-07-02T08:xx — master startup COMPLETE, Lane 1 live

- **Master session:** `rock-solid-master-4091b2` (opus, high). Retire Trent's planning chat.
- **In flight:** **Lane 1 orch `lane-1-b0cea3`** (fable, high, own window) launched + assigned groups A → B → E. Assignment delivered via inbox (id 14d8bb).
- **Done:** `rock-solid` off `main`@ca0d70c + pushed; impl pool wt-1/2/3 + `wt-master` created & installed; this tracker committed (9b7022f) + pushed; Lane 1 orch launched & assigned; 30-min master wake armed (bg task belxirmfo).
- **Verified evidence:** `git worktree list` = 4 rock-solid worktrees; `twux list` showed master alive; `twux launch` returned `lane-1-b0cea3`; send-message returned "delivered ... [nudged]"; disk 8.3 GB free after all 4 installs.
- **Next actions (on wake):** verify lane-1-b0cea3 alive + progressing (`twux list`, capture if idle); drain inbox; merge any handed-off+reviewed group branches → rock-solid in wt-master + full sweep; re-arm 30-min wake. When Lane 1 completes (A, B, E merged), fire the Lane 2 orch (groups F→G→H→I).
- **Not yet asked of Trent:** nothing (escalation/final-gate only, via AskUserQuestion).
