# Rock Solid — master tracker

Master orch state for issues #46–#57 (49 slices). Operating manual: `docs/plans/2026-07-02-rock-solid/ORCHESTRATION.md` (rev 2). Slice plan: `docs/plans/2026-07-02-rock-solid/slices/INDEX.md`. This tracker + those two docs must always be enough for a successor master to take over (compaction can wipe context at any wake).

---

## ESCALATIONS / notes

- **Disk headroom (MONITOR):** volume was at 99% / ~8.3 GB free at initiative start. pnpm's hardlinked global store makes each worktree `node_modules` nearly free (verified: 4 installs, no measurable disk delta). **Risk remains for Lane 4** (desktop/tauri) — Rust `target/` build dirs are NOT hardlinked and can be large. Watch `df -h /Users/trent` before/around Lane 4; if a build fails on ENOSPC, that is a blocking escalation to Trent.
- **Non-blocking future-slice residuals (from group reports; NOT in scope for Rock Solid):** (F) — none blocking. (G, group-G.md) per-hosting timebase for trigger-hosted textures (doc 06 wish; needs a voice/bus-level flag — future slice); helix/wipe-3d timebase conversion follow-ups; 2 thumbnails static by nature. (H, group-H.md) modifier per-param envelopes persist but DON'T render-apply yet — deferred to doc 10 = **group I (S33–S38)**, so NOT open once I lands; 1D-only Mirror/Bloom (geometry at modifier seam = future); Echo ring ~1s. Surface to Trent post-initiative, not now.
- **Cross-group merge drift (process lesson):** group/E was branched off rock-solid PRE-group-B, so B×E independently edited shared files (`store.svelte.ts`, two inspectors) → non-trivial semantic conflict at master-merge time. Handed back to the lane orch to integrate (merge rock-solid into group/E + resolve) rather than hand-merge entangled feature code as master. **Guidance for Lane 2+:** lane orch should `git merge rock-solid` into a group branch (resolving) BEFORE handing it off, so master merges are clean — especially when groups within a lane overlap in time.
- **⚙️ EFFORT/COST POLICY CHANGE — Trent DIRECT directive (2026-07-02 21:54, given in the lane-2 session; overrides ORCHESTRATION.md's opus/xhigh impl row for ALL remaining work — Lanes 2→4).** After F+G burn analysis (xhigh on mechanical batch slices = biggest overspend; handoff reports were 28–49% of group insertions; narrow-pane paste bug killed 2 launches): (1) impls default **opus/MEDIUM**, **high** only where genuinely needed (tracers / ui-significant / engine seams), **NEVER xhigh** — compensated by a stricter per-slice orch review (full diff read before every merge; defects prompted back to the impl). (2) Followers get **only the slice file + predecessor tracer report**, NOT the mechanism/context doc. (3) **All launches in own windows, never split panes.** (4) Report contract slimmed to **<=30 lines** (no commits/files lists; context pack only when a dependent exists). **MASTER MUST propagate this to the Lane 3 (J→K) and Lane 4 (C→D→L) orch assignments** (bake into the send-message, since lane orchs still read ORCHESTRATION.md which says xhigh).
- **Topology deviation (recorded):** the doc names a 3-worktree pool (`wt-1|2|3`). I additionally created **`../ledrums-wt/wt-master` on `rock-solid`** for the master's own tracker commits + group-branch merges + post-merge sweeps. Rationale: the main working tree (`~/Documents/dev/ledrums`) is dirty with Trent's unrelated local desktop/tauri work (`.dmg`, tauri configs, `.infisical.json`) and must stay pristine; a single branch can't be checked out in two worktrees. `wt-1/2/3` remain the impl pool exactly as the doc specifies.

## Worktree pool

| Worktree | Path | Role | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| wt-master | `../ledrums-wt/wt-master` | master: tracker commits, group merges, post-merge sweep | on `rock-solid` |
| wt-1 | `../ledrums-wt/wt-1` | impl pool | free (detached) |
| wt-2 | `../ledrums-wt/wt-2` | impl pool | free (detached) |
| wt-3 | `../ledrums-wt/wt-3` | impl pool | free (detached) |

All four `pnpm install`ed. Assignment discipline: `git -C <wt> status --porcelain` must be EMPTY before assigning; impl starts with `git -C <wt> fetch --all && git -C <wt> switch -c slice/S## group/<letter>`.

## Branch topology

- Integration: **`rock-solid`** (created off `main` @ ca0d70c, pushed to origin). Merges to `main` only at the final gate, with Trent.
- Group: `group/<letter>` off `rock-solid` (lane orch creates at group start).
- Slice: `slice/S##` off the group branch (impl creates in its worktree).

## State snapshot (per wake — newest on top)

### 2026-07-03T00:40 — Group I 1/6 (serial chain)

- **group/I: S33 merged**; S34-modulation-graph in flight (opus/high, ui graph layer). Chain gates the rest: S35/S36/S37 need S34, S38 needs S36+S37. Usage 5h 45%. Inbox empty; rock-solid da145b5. No handoff.
- **Next:** S34 lands → S35/S36/S37 wave → S38 → I integrate+review+handoff → master merge → LANE 2 DONE → fire Lane 3 (J→K). 30-min cadence.

### 2026-07-03T00:10 — Lane 2 on Group I (last group)

- **group/I started:** S33-modulation-core (gate; opus/high engine seam) in flight. Chain: S33→S34→{S35/S36/S37}→S38 (mostly serial). Usage 5h 36% (healthy). Inbox empty; rock-solid unchanged (36ae20c).
- **Next:** I completes → integrate+review → handoff → master merge → **LANE 2 DONE** → fire Lane 3 orch (J→K) WITH new policy. 30-min cadence.

### 2026-07-03T00:0x — GROUP H MERGED (26/49)

- **group/H MERGED** (#54, S28–S32) → rock-solid **f852eb4** (`--no-ff`; pre-integrated @8f69a02 → NO conflicts). Review PASS (full diff vs doc 06 §C + AGENTS.md). **18 modifiers shipped**, graph-node model per LOCKED decision, registry-driven UI.
- **Master sweep GREEN:** typecheck 0 (web 2267); **1483 tests / 0 skips** (io 13 · core 474 · protocol 1 · server 176 · web 819).
- **Progress: 26/49 slices** (L1: 11 + F:7 + G:3 + H:5). Lane 2 remaining: **I (S33–S38)** — starting now; I's doc-10 work render-applies H's modifier envelopes (closes the H residual).
- **Policy payoff (lane orch report):** group H = first full group under Trent's tiering (2×high + 3×medium + orch full-diff reviews) → 5/5 first-try passes, one morning, big cost cut vs xhigh.
- **Next:** merge group/I on handoff → Lane 2 DONE → fire Lane 3 orch (J→K) with new policy. 30-min cadence (wake bzxpvx2v1).

### 2026-07-02T23:39 — Group H 2/5; new policy curbing burn

- **group/H: 2/5 merged** (S28, S29); S30/S31/S32 in flight — all opus/**medium**, own windows (new policy fully applied). Usage 5h **21%** with 3 parallel impls — markedly lower burn than F/G's xhigh (which hit 70%+ walls). Policy working.
- Inbox empty; rock-solid unchanged (50949b7). No handoff yet.
- **Next:** S30/S31/S32 merge → H integrate+review → handoff → master merge; then I (S33–S38). 30-min cadence.

### 2026-07-02T23:08 — reset; Lane 2 resumed (Group H) under NEW policy

- **5h reset (5% used; next 04:00 UTC).** **Lane 2 resumed autonomously** — no nudge.
- **NEW effort/cost policy in effect** (Trent direct, see notes above): impls opus/medium default, never xhigh, own windows, slim reports, stricter orch review. Visible: S29 launched opus/**high** (ui/engine seam — justified) in its own window.
- **group/H:** S28 (modifier engine core + Trail) MERGED into group/H; S29-modifier-graph in flight (needs S01+S28). Then S30/S31/S32.
- rock-solid unchanged (9d23a5a) — no H handoff yet.
- **Next:** merge group/H then group/I on handoff (integrated+reviewed). Lane 2 DONE → fire **Lane 3 orch (J→K) WITH THE NEW POLICY baked into its assignment** (+ K.S43/S45 need J.S40). 30-min cadence.

### 2026-07-02T19:5x — GROUP G MERGED (21/49); H waits for reset

- **group/G MERGED** (#52, S25–S27) → rock-solid **6b80d0e** (`--no-ff`; pre-integrated with rock-solid@b363239 incl. group/F → NO conflicts). Review PASS no fixes (41-classification timebase audit pinned; determinism/no-phase-snap tested; core purity clean).
- **Master sweep GREEN:** typecheck 0 (web 2238); **1346 tests / 0 skips** (io 13 · core 363 · protocol 1 · server 176 · web 793).
- **Progress: 21/49 slices** (Lane 1: 11 + F: 7 + G: 3). Lane 2 remaining: H (S28–S32), I (S33–S38).
- **⛔ BUDGET: 5h 73%** (over 70% wall). **Group H blocked until 23:00 UTC reset**; lane orch scheduled its own reset wake. Non-blocking residuals recorded in notes above.
- **Master wake:** backstop b7zkswg4q (~20:10) will stretch to ~23:07 UTC reset per its prompt. No master work until then (H handoff won't come before H even starts).
- **Next (post-reset):** verify Lane 2 resumed (nudge if parked); merge group/H then group/I; then Lane 2 DONE → fire Lane 3 orch (J→K).

### 2026-07-02T19:40 — Group G 2/3, budget wall (69%)

- **group/G: 2/3 merged**, S26 in flight (busy). Usage 5h **69%** — at the 70% wall. G will finish (in-flight), integrate + review, hand off. **H (S28–S32) will be budget-blocked** until 23:00 UTC reset once >70%.
- Inbox empty; rock-solid unchanged (9198018). G handoff will re-invoke master via inbox; 30-min wake is backstop only.
- **Next:** merge group/G on handoff; then H blocked-till-reset likely → will stretch master wake to reset if so. Fire Lane 3 (J→K) when Lane 2 done.

### 2026-07-02T19:09 — Lane 2 on Group G

- **group/G started:** S25-timebase (gate slice; S26/S27 depend on it) in flight. Usage 5h 49% (healthy). Inbox empty; rock-solid unchanged (dd9083a) — no handoff.
- **Next:** S25 merges → S26/S27 launch → G integrates + review → handoff → master merge. Then H (S28–S32), I (S33–S38). 30-min cadence.

### 2026-07-02T18:5x — GROUP F MERGED (18/49 slices)

- **group/F MERGED** (#51, S18–S24) → rock-solid **0cb5c73** (`--no-ff`; group/F was pre-integrated with rock-solid@453576e per the new rule → NO conflicts, ff-able). Lane review PASS (core purity clean over 76-file diff, swatch-UI-only honored, 41/41 effect audit closed, 2 trivial findings fixed in-branch d02cf34).
- **Master sweep GREEN:** typecheck 0 (web 2238 files); **1300 tests / 0 skips** (io 13 · core 327 · protocol 1 · server 176 · web 783).
- **Progress: 18/49 slices** (Lane 1: 11 + F: 7). Lane 2 remaining: G (S25–S27), H (S28–S32), I (S33–S38).
- Lane orch already proceeding to Group G; will read group-E.md before H. rock-solid now has F for G/H/I to branch/integrate from.
- **Next:** merge group/G when handed off; continue H→I; then fire Lane 3 (J→K). 30-min cadence (wake bchxm1mv5 active).

### 2026-07-02T18:38 — Lane 2 group/F nearly done (S22 last)

- **group/F: 6/7 slices merged** (S18/S19/S20/S21/S22*/S23/S24 — S22 in flight, last). Usage 5h 37% (healthy). Inbox empty; rock-solid unchanged (af96b35) — no handoff yet.
- **Next:** S22 lands → lane integrates rock-solid + full group review → hands off group/F → master merges (expect clean) + sweep. Then group/G (S25–S27). 30-min cadence.

### 2026-07-02T18:07 — reset; Lane 2 resumed ON ITS OWN

- **5h reset to 10%** (next 09:00+10 = 23:00 UTC). 7d 29%. Full runway.
- **Lane 2 resumed autonomously** — no nudge needed (its own --at reset wake fired; wave 2 S20/S21/S24 launched 18:01–18:02 UTC).
- **group/F: wave 1 merged** — S18/S19/S23 → group/F @ 1ff3fd0 (lane sweeps green, 1232 tests, slice branches deleted). **Wave 2 in flight:** S20-colour-batch2, S21-colour-batch3, S24-envelope-editor; S22 next. 3/7 F slices merged.
- Lane orch keeps its own docs/handoff/rock-solid/lane-2-state.md. rock-solid unchanged (7c26130) — no group/F handoff yet.
- **Next:** normal 30-min cadence; merge group/F when handed off (integrated + reviewed); then G→H→I. Fire Lane 3 (J→K) when Lane 2 done.

### 2026-07-02T14:59 — Lane 2 F underway, approaching budget wall

- **Lane 2 `lane-2-988e46` alive.** group/F created; started the 3 dep-free F slices (S18/S19/S23, front-loading S18+S23 for H/I). **S19 merged into group/F**; S18+S23 in flight (idle).
- **Usage 5h 72%** (just past 70% budget). Remaining F slices gated: S20 needs S18 (unmerged), S24 needs S23 (unmerged), S21/S22 need S19 (merged) but launching them would breach the 70% cap → lane orch should PAUSE now. This protects Trent's interactive headroom (he's active).
- **No master work pending:** group/F is 7 slices, ~2 in; won't hand off until post-reset. rock-solid unchanged (a6f4785).
- **Master wake aligned to reset (~18:07 UTC / 04:07+10)** instead of 30-min polls into a paused system — conserves the shared 5h budget. An inbox handoff/blocker would re-invoke me sooner regardless.
- **Next (post-reset):** verify Lane 2 resumed (nudge if parked, like Lane 1); merge group/F when handed off; continue G→H→I.

### 2026-07-02T14:2x — ✅ LANE 1 COMPLETE; Lane 2 launched

- **group/E re-handed off clean** (lane orch merged rock-solid into group/E, resolved all 4 B×E conflicts exactly as instructed; pinned the receiveInputEcho-records-activity seam with +2 tests in store.echo-gate.test.ts). No conflicts on my side.
- **group/E MERGED** → rock-solid as **ab5bc96** (`--no-ff`), pushed (local==origin). Master full sweep GREEN: typecheck 0 (web 2227 files); **1177 tests / 0 skips** (io 13 · core 251 · protocol 1 · server 176 · web 736).
- **LANE 1 DONE** — all 11 slices (A/B/E) in rock-solid. **Killed lane-1-b0cea3** (resumable: `twux resume --session lane-1-b0cea3`).
- **LANE 2 LAUNCHED: lane-2-988e46** (fable/high, own window). Assigned F→G→H→I (msg 660997) with the NEW rule: integrate rock-solid into each group + resolve BEFORE handoff. Usage 5h 58% at launch (limited headroom before 18:00 UTC reset; lane orch will pause at 70%).
- **Next:** 30-min cadence; watch for Lane 2 group hand-offs (F first) → merge → sweep. group/A,B,E branches still exist locally (merged; optional tidy).

### 2026-07-02T14:1x — LANE 1 slices done; group/E merge BOUNCED (B×E conflict)

- **Lane 1 all 11 slices complete** (A:S01, B:S02–S05, E:S12–S17). Lane orch handed off group/E (PASS, its sweep 1111 tests). A+B already in rock-solid.
- **group/E did NOT merge cleanly** into rock-solid (has A+B): 4 conflicts — design-system.html (regen), PatchZoneInspector + TriggerSourceInspector (additive UNION), and **store.svelte.ts (4 hunks, semantically entangled)**: B's input-activity-badge (recordInputActivity, S04) vs E's authority refactor (receiveInputEcho, S12) both rewrote input handling. Risk: E's `receiveInputEcho` must ALSO recordInputActivity or B's badges silently break on the echo path — likely UNTESTED seam.
- **ABORTED my merge** (rock-solid untouched @ 7929593). **Handed back to lane-1-b0cea3** (msg 0e49b3) with exact resolution steps: merge rock-solid into group/E in a pool worktree, resolve the 4 conflicts, ADD a test for receiveInputEcho-records-activity, re-review the store seam, re-hand-off. Lane orch NOT killed.
- **Lane 2 still deferred** (Lane 1 not complete until group/E merges).
- **Next:** await re-handoff of group/E → clean merge (group/E will contain rock-solid) + sweep → Lane 1 DONE → fire Lane 2 orch. Check wake ~18 min.

### 2026-07-02T13:49 — wake: group/E nearly done (S16+S17 last)

- **group/E:** S12/S13/S14/S15 all merged into group/E (lane orch, 4 slice merges). **S16-looks-authoring + S17-layersdock in flight** (last two E slices) — then group review + handoff = Lane 1 complete.
- Usage 5h 34% (healthy). Inbox empty; rock-solid unchanged (no group/E handoff yet — nothing for master to merge).
- **Next:** await group/E handoff → merge (wt-master) + sweep → Lane 1 DONE → fire Lane 2 orch (F→G→H→I). 30-min wake re-armed.

### 2026-07-02T13:05 — RESET reached, Lane 1 resumed (nudged)

- **5h budget reset to 0%** (next reset 2026-07-03T04:00+10). Full runway.
- **Lane 1 `lane-1-b0cea3`** was found parked idle at prompt 5 min past its 13:00 reset wake (context healthy 19%; footer showed stale 91%). Rather than risk idle crew, I sent a **resume nudge** (msg 629a67) with dup-safety instructions (check `twux list` before relaunching any S13–S17 impl). It should now launch the E wave: S13+S14+S15 parallel → S17 → S16.
- **group/E** exists with **S12 merged** (lane orch, pre-pause, sweep green 1047 tests — authority principle: echo=learn-only, all outbound sim gated on link). Remaining E: S13/S14/S15/S17/S16 → group review → hand off to master.
- **A+B merged** to rock-solid (a91dbbf, 74ffd7a). **Lane 2 still deferred** (serial; fires when group/E merged).
- **CONFIRMED 13:18:** E wave live — S13-firegraph (wt-1), S14-drumlink (wt-2), S15-section-looks (wt-3), all opus/xhigh, no dups (dup-safety held). Lane orch resumed (msg df2c81). Pipeline: S17 → free worktree, S16 after S15, then group review + handoff = Lane 1 done.
- **Next:** 30-min cadence; merge group/E when handed off; then fire Lane 2 orch (F→G→H→I).

### 2026-07-02T09:41 — GROUP B MERGED + BUDGET PAUSE

- **group/B merged** (#47, S02–S05) → rock-solid as merge commit **74ffd7a** (`--no-ff`, ort), pushed (local == origin). Verified report + diff scope (web-only + 1-line .gitignore, 4 pure modules, tests, design-system engaged) before merging.
- **Conflict resolved:** only `docs/design-system.html` conflicted (generated file — both A and B regenerated it). Source `.svelte` styleguide files auto-merged cleanly; I re-ran `pnpm design-system` to regenerate the HTML from merged sources (0 markers). This is the standing recipe for design-system.html merge conflicts.
- **Master sweep green (A+B combined):** typecheck 0 (web 2220 files); **1101 tests / 0 skips** (io 13 · core 234 · protocol 1 · server 170 · web 683).
- **⛔ BUDGET PAUSE:** lane orch reported 5h usage hit 86% (msg f205b1); now **89%**, resets **2026-07-02T23:00:00+10:00 (13:00 UTC)**. 7d 18% (healthy). Lane 1 stopped NEW launches; S12 finishing then merging into group/E; E remainder (S13/S14/S15/S17 → S16) BLOCKED until reset. Lane orch scheduled its own `--at` reset wake w/ pre-written assignments.
- **Lane 2 NOT started** (lanes serial — Lane 2 fires only when Lane 1 completes = group/E merged, which is post-reset). No master action until reset.
- **Next (at/after 13:00 UTC reset):** verify Lane 1 resumed + progressing; await group/E hand-off → merge → Lane 1 done → fire Lane 2 orch (F→G→H→I). Re-align master wake to the reset (pending 09:44 wake will re-arm it there).

### 2026-07-02T09:2x — GROUP A MERGED → rock-solid

- **group/A merged** (#46, S01) into rock-solid as merge commit **a91dbbf** (`--no-ff`, ort), pushed to origin (local == origin/rock-solid == a91dbbf). Lane orch verdict was PASS/no-findings; I re-read the report + diff scope (web-only, graph-editor hardening, tests + design-system regenerated in-change, no core/IO impurity), merged, ran my own full sweep.
- **Master sweep green:** typecheck 0 (6 pkgs, web svelte-check 2208 files 0 errors); tests pass (web 619/619; merge clean single-slice so io/core/protocol/server unchanged from lane orch's verified 1037/no-skips). `derived_inert` Svelte warnings on stderr are pre-existing noise, not failures.
- **Lane 1 continues:** B has S02+S03 merged (S03 sweep was pending at hand-off), S04 in flight, S05 next; E not started. Told lane orch (ack 640e55) to branch group/E + future groups off LATEST rock-solid (fetch first). group/A branch left intact (merged; optional tidy later).
- **Next:** await group/B then group/E hand-offs. When all three merged → Lane 1 done → fire Lane 2 orch (F→G→H→I).

### 2026-07-02T09:14 — wake 1: Lane 1 progressing, no merges yet

- **Lane 1 `lane-1-b0cea3` alive + progressing.** Reported (08:50): ACK'd, `group/A`+`group/B` created off rock-solid; impls S01→wt-1, S02→wt-2, S03→wt-3 launched (opus/xhigh). At 09:14 `twux list`: S01/S03/S04 impls alive (S04 launched 09:08 → S02 already landed, freed wt-2). Lane usage 5h ~30%.
- **Merges into rock-solid:** none yet (rock-solid log still at tracker commits; no group handed off). Nothing for master to do this cycle.
- **Verified evidence:** inbox msg c32b58 (progress); `twux list` shows lane-1 + S01/S03/S04 impls alive; `git branch group/*` = group/A, group/B; wt-master rock-solid log unchanged.
- **Next actions (next wake):** same cadence; watch for group A/B hand-off (→ merge in wt-master + sweep). When Lane 1 done → fire Lane 2 orch (F→G→H→I).

### 2026-07-02T08:xx — master startup COMPLETE, Lane 1 live

- **Master session:** `rock-solid-master-4091b2` (opus, high). Retire Trent's planning chat.
